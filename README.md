# Caesar Cipher – Python Project 🔐

This is a simple Python program that implements the **Caesar Cipher algorithm** for text encryption and decryption.

## 📌 Task Description
**Task-01 – Prodigy Infotech Internship**

> Create a Python program that can encrypt and decrypt text using the Caesar Cipher algorithm.  
> Allow users to input a message and a shift value to perform encryption and decryption.

## 🚀 How It Works
- The program takes **plaintext input** from the user.
- Asks for a **shift key** (an integer).
- Encrypts the message by shifting each letter by the key value.
- Also allows decryption using the same key.

## 📂 Files Included
- `caesar_cipher.py` – Main Python file containing the Caesar Cipher logic.

## 🧪 How to Run the Program

1. Open a terminal or command prompt.
2. Navigate to the folder where the file is saved.
3. Run the following command:

```bash
python caesar_cipher.py
